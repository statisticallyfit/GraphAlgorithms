 *   Out-degree centrality measures the centrality of the nodes based on its degree,
 *   letting you see how a node influences its neighborhood
 * definition: >
 *   Out-Degree centrality returns the sum of the number of outgoing edges for each node
 *   in the graph.
 * implementation_details: >
 *   This algorithm is designed to run in parallel given its high degree of parallelism.
 * applications:
 *   - Since out-degree centrality accounts for the connections of the nodes, it can be
 *     used to see the influence a node has over the nodes in its immediate neighborhood.

 *       The difference between these two algorithms is the restrictions on the outgoing
 *       edges used to compute the centrality score.

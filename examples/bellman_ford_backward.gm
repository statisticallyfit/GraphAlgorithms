 *   Reversed bellman-ford finds multiple shortest paths at the same time
 * definition: >
 *   This variant of the Bellman-Ford algorithm tries to find the shortest path (if there 
 *   is one) between the given source and destination nodes in a reversed fashion using
 *   the incoming edges instead of the outgoing, while minimizing the distance or cost
 *   associated to each edge in the graph.
 * implementation_details: >
 *   This algorithm is designed to run in parallel given its high degree of parallelization.
 * applications:
 *   - This algorithm can be implemented in optimization problems that can be represented
 *     with a graph structure.
 * compare_to:
 *   - id: pgx_builtin_p3_single_source_all_destinations_bellman_ford
 *     difference: >
 *       Compared to the classic implementation of Bellman-Ford this variant is just
 *       different in the way it traverses the graph, since it will use incoming edges
 *       instead of outgoing, which gives it its reversed feature.
